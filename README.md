# üìà Daily Brent Oil Price Forecasting  
*A comparative ARIMA vs LSTM / GAN case-study*

---

Project overview
This repository contains all code, data sets, and documentation for a Master-level
time-series assignment that:

1. **Cleans and explores** daily Brent‚Äêspot quotations (Jul 2020 ‚Äì Dec 2022).  
2. **Builds a classical ARIMA( p,d,q ) model**, selected by AIC via exhaustive
   grid search.  
3. **Implements two deep-learning alternatives**
   * **Conditional GAN** (PyTorch TimeGAN-lite variant)  
4. **Generates 24-month forecasts** and compares them with realised
   post-sample prices.
